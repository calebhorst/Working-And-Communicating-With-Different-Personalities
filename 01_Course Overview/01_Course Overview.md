## Course Overview
```
Hey everyone. My name is Jason Alba, and welcome to my course, Working and Communicating with Different Personalities. I am CEO of JibberJobber.com, a CRM for job seekers. In this course, we're going to talk about our relationships with people who we work with. I created this course because people are different and working with different personalities can be confusing. Some of the major topics we'll cover include personalities in general and what learning about personalities means, the Myers‑Briggs personality assessment, as well as the DiSC personality assessment. We'll talk about how knowledge about personalities can improve our relationships and help us become better communicators. By the end of this course, you should have a much better idea of how you can work with people who have different personalities. From here, you should feel comfortable diving into working and communicating with different personalities with courses on becoming a better listener, how to get your next promotion, and leading with emotional intelligence. I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn more about yourself and others with the Working and Communicating with Different Personalities course, at Pluralsight.
