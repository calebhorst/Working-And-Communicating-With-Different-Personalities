## Working with Others
```
There are few roles where you don't have to work with others. Even the most introverted person has to interface with others sometimes. Normally, we have a boss and colleagues we have to work with, sometimes we have prospects and clients to take care of. For some of us, this is fine and even exciting. I've found I can't go long without interacting with others, even though I considered myself introverted. When the COVID pandemic impacted our workforce in 2020 and people were working remotely alone, there was a lot of conversation about how working in isolation impacted our productivity, our mental health, the future of work, and more. For others, working with others feels annoying or maybe some level of terrifying. I've known people who are excellent at what they do, but I'm not sure I've heard them say 10 sentences over the years. They take pride in their work and the quality they deliver, but they don't want to interact with others to the point of actively avoiding interaction. Understanding our own personalities and tendencies is important. When we understand how and when we want to interact with others, we can strategize how to best work with them. We might realize when our best time to work with others is or how we best communicate, educate, and influence. Understanding others can help you figure out and accept why, how, and when they interact with and work with you. Things we assume about those we work with can be entirely wrong, especially when we don't understand ourselves or them.
