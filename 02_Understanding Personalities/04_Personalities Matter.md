## Personalities Matter
```
I want to share a few experiences I've had when working with others who have personalities I just didn't understand. While there was plenty of frustration, we generally got our work done. I think there's a balance between I always like everyone I work with all the time and we are a highly productive team. The purpose of work is not to always like everyone you work with all the time, but working with people we don't like or who don't like us could be miserable. You'll have to figure out where that line is for your own job satisfaction, but just realize it's not always going to be awesome. Rusty, which is his real name, was one of my best bosses ever. Rusty is the kind of boss or colleague you would follow around as long as you could, even changing jobs and companies. Rusty is a phenomenal, outstanding human and leader. I was in a meeting with Rusty when he was giving me some direction on a project and I was suffering pretty harshly from imposter syndrome. I kept wondering, why did he even hire me? Why not just do this himself since he has thought through every last detail? I didn't realize two things. First, he was doing a massive brain dump with a lot of detail, but he wasn't expecting me to follow every direction or implement every detail. He wanted to do a knowledge transfer and then free me so I could bring my best ideas and work to his ideas. Second, I didn't understand that my greatest value was to execute on his vision. I was wondering, why doesn't he do this instead of appreciating that he trusted me to be an extension of him, which is really quite flattering. Years ago, I worked as a web developer with Sally, which is not her real name. Sally was a frustrated person. She was fairly new to her role and didn't understand enough about technology to effectively manage me. She had a lot of personal things going on, which only complicated our relationship and communication. Anyway, Sally was usually very short with me. After a while, I figured out she was not angry or impatient with me, rather she was frustrated with herself and her ability to manage me and my work. I felt uncomfortable around her because of the way she acted around me, but if I just understood her need for perfection, especially in her own role, I would have understood her issues had nothing to do with me and I would have thought and behaved differently. I worked with a colleague who was always very short with me. I honestly thought they hated me or despised working with me. I later learned through observation that this person was like this with everyone. They were very competent in their role, but left a lot of people not liking working with them. When I realized that was just how they were and it wasn't anything personal or a reflection of who they liked, I changed how I worked with them. Honestly, this realization into how they worked and communicated changed our relationship entirely. Even though they still act that way, I give them a lot of leeway. I've changed my expectations. Not only are we good together, but we found more opportunities to work together. I'm sure in your personal and professional life you have your own stories similar to these. How people act, communicate, and think impacts work relationships, productivity, and job satisfaction. Understanding ourselves and others can change everything. It's like we see things through a different lens, a much clearer lens. Understanding personalities is critical when working with someone who seems lazy, when working with someone who solves problems different than you do, when working with customers who seem to not want to talk to you, when working with a boss who regularly rejects your ideas, when asking for a raise or presenting career changing information, when asking someone for help, when trying to persuade others. Understanding personalities, yours and those of others, can greatly impact your communication and effectiveness in these and other situations you encounter multiple times a day.
