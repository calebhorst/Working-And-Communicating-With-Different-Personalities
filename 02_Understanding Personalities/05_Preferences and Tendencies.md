## Preferences and Tendencies
```
I recently had a great chat with Jane Roqueplot, a friend who specializes in training leaders and coaches on using the DiSC assessment, which we'll go into deeper later. Jane has been teaching resume writers, career coaches, and HR and business managers how to use DiSC as a tool to help with various things, including how to position a job candidate better, jobs to focus on, as well as how teams can work better with one another. The premise for working better as a team is that if you understand yourself and one another, you can understand how best to work and communicate with one another. As I was talking with Jane about this course, she reemphasized something I had heard before. Results from the DiSC assessment, like the Myersâ€‘Briggs assessment, help you understand tendencies and preferences. Instead of declaring what your personality is, which can be too stereotyped, think of assessment results as a tool to help you understand how you prefer to give or receive information, make decisions, etc. Assessment results help you understand how you tend to act or react, think or talk, and accept or analyze information you get. In turn, this impacts how you give information. This is a really profound concept. When I first learned about these assessments, which I wrongly thought were tests, I thought you would find out what your personality was and then you pretty much acted within the scope of the definition of that personality. It was as if your personality definition locked you into how you would be, react, think, and communicate for the rest of your life. This felt very confining. Instead of thinking of assessment results as absolutes, think about how they can help you understand tendencies. You tend to want more data when making decisions, you tend to want to talk about personal and family things before jumping into business matters, you tend to want to get work done quickly and completely, you tend to value processes over people or people over processes. Understanding what people tend to do is empowering. Thinking about personalities through the lens of tendencies instead of discrete rules or boundaries changed the way I looked at these assessments.

## Notes
- DiSC and Myers-Briggs assessments help understand tendencies and preferences rather than defining a rigid personality.
- Assessment results serve as tools to understand how one prefers to give or receive information, make decisions, and act/react in various situations.
- These assessments provide insights into communication styles, decision-making processes, and information processing.
- Understanding tendencies empowers individuals to adapt their communication and behavior based on different situations and interactions.
- Viewing personalities through the lens of tendencies rather than strict rules or boundaries can lead to a more flexible and adaptable approach to working with others.
