## Wisdom from a Retired Therapist
```
There's a lot of controversy around defining personality traits, as well as assessments like the Myers‑Briggs. I reached out to a friend, Vern Cox, who has had a long career in therapy. He's been a marriage and family therapist, as well as a psychotherapist. My question to him was, is the Myers‑Briggs a legitimate tool? His response was, "The Myers‑Briggs Type Indicator is a legitimate tool, and I think it's one of the better ones." He continues, "The only thing I don't like about it, and most other assessments, is this: if you score only 1 point different in one of the categories, you're completely in that category, even though your score is very slightly in that category." He continues, "You are then boxed in rather than having a continuum that would indicate how different you are in each category." This is the same criticism I've heard from others that Myers‑Briggs and other personality assessments don't take into account how close you are to another category. By the way, there are 16 categories or results from a Myers‑Briggs assessment. It might be nice if you could somehow say you were very close to another category. I took a quick and free Myers‑Briggs assessment online. There are plenty of sites to choose from to do this. My results were ESFJ. One of the sites I used, 16personalities.com, gave me a beautiful graphic to help me understand how E or S or F or J I really am. As you can see in my results, I'm J for judging. The graphic indicated I was really close to the alternative, P. I found that to be really interesting information. I could easily go either way. In contrast, it said I was a strong extrovert and not very close to being introverted. While not perfect, this gives me data points to think about. I want to see how close I am to other categories. Instead of just saying I'm an E, or extroverted, and hear all the characteristics, I want to know how much of an extrovert I am or how close I actually get to being introverted. Someone else recommended understanding the differences between each of the results. They said you can then do a self‑assessment to perhaps get more accurate results than you might get by taking a questionnaire. Whatever your assessment results are, you might not be that 100%. You can also change over time. I took four assessments within an hour and a half and I got different results from each one. This course isn't about beating up or discounting any personality assessment. Instead, I want you to have a foundation to help you understand why people do things the way they do and how they make decisions. I want you to work on improving relationships with others and be more effective with your persuasion skills, and I definitely want you to learn more about yourself and your tendencies and what you lead with
