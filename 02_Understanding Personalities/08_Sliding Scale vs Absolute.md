## Sliding Scale vs. Absolute
```
Let's build on my therapist friend's problem he had with personality assessments, which was that they label you with clear definitions of who you are or how you'll act. Remember, he said he would like to see how close you are to other labels or groupings. Your tendencies might not fall squarely into one group or another, rather they might be a combination of various groups. I like to think about our personalities as not so finite, like you would have with absolutes, but rather on something of a sliding scale. A sliding scale helps you know how close you are to different categories. This can give you a better idea of which characteristics you tend to gravitate towards. I like to think of your personality, tendencies, and preferences being on a sliding scale. An E on your Myersâ€‘Briggs doesn't mean you're completely extroverted. You might usually be extroverted, but sometimes tend to act like an introvert. Thinking about the results of personality assessments along a sliding scale can help us avoid stereotyping people. Instead of making assumptions based on their results, we can think, I know you tend to be an extrovert, but that doesn't mean you'll act like an extrovert in every situation. Sometimes we think we can accurately predict how someone will act based on their personality results, but we wouldn't be right all the time. I'm at neither end of the scale and can tend to be more extroverted or introverted, depending on multiple factors, like who is in the room, how comfortable I am with the subject matter or what mood I'm in, even how tired or hungry I might be. When we think of results along a sliding scale instead of absolutes, it's easier to understand why someone did something that seems contrary to their assessment results. We, as humans, are complex beings. We're allowed to do things differently than what our personality assessment dictates. A few minutes ago we talked about preferences and tendencies. Those two words do not indicate absolutes. They actually leave a lot of room open for variances. You prefer to do something a certain way, but that doesn't mean you always or even mostly do it that way. This is nicely aligned with the concept of a sliding scale. The sliding scale is an important concept when it comes to assessment results. It can help you come to terms with your own and others' categorizations.

## Notes
- Personality assessments often label individuals with clear definitions but may not capture the complexity of their tendencies.
- Viewing personalities on a sliding scale instead of absolutes allows for a more nuanced understanding.
- Personality traits can vary depending on factors like the situation, mood, and personal comfort.
- Avoid stereotyping people based solely on their assessment results.
- Preferences and tendencies imply flexibility rather than rigidity.
- The sliding scale concept aids in comprehending and accepting personality assessment results.
