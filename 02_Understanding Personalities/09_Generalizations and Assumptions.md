## Generalizations and Assumptions
```
One of the reasons people dislike personality assessments is they tend to put us into discrete buckets, I think to help us understand people easier. For example, if I say someone is introverted, you immediately have some idea of how they'll act. A problem with that is I might have some assumptions about how they'll act while you have other assumptions, and both of us could be wrong. Coming up with labels and categories to understand others can be convenient, but they can be misleading. As we talked about with the sliding scale concept, labels could also be wrong. I've been in conversations where people say, for example, John is an introvert, so he won't want to meet with the executives to pitch our ideas. That could be a misuse or an abuse of these assessment results. Maybe John would love nothing more than to represent our team and make some very strong arguments to pitch our ideas. Maybe he's been taking courses to improve his presenting and persuasion skills. Declaring labels and categories and then making judgments and decisions based on those labels and categories without having the proper conversations could have an impact on our productivity, careers, effectiveness, relationships, and more. I've seen great leaders move beyond the labels and assumptions and sit down with people to ask them what they think, where they're at, and if they'd be interested in new opportunities. When we skip those conversations and only use assumptions based on labels, we're missing out on a lot of great potential. We tend to despise stereotyping, but that's what happens when we generalize and assume based on labels. And we all do it in many parts of our life. It's easy for us to do it, but when we're the victim of stereotyping, we tend to think, but I'm different, I really am. The funny thing is we even generalize and label ourselves, which can be harmful if left unchecked. I find people tend to be harder on themselves or not appreciate the good as much as others can. My friend Vern, the therapist, said this, which is a way to think beyond assumptions. "I don't want just the four letters to tell me who and what I am. I want to understand how close I am to the other four letters.

## Notes
- Personality assessments can lead to discrete categorizations, which might not fully capture an individual's behavior.
- Labels and categories can be convenient but may also be misleading and lead to incorrect assumptions.
- Making judgments and decisions solely based on labels can impact productivity, relationships, and more.
- Effective leaders move beyond assumptions and engage in conversations to understand individuals better.
- Stereotyping, both self-imposed and by others, can limit personal growth and understanding.
- Exploring how close one is to other personality traits can provide a more nuanced view of personality.
