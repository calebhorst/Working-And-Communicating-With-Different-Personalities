## Moods and Circumstances
```
Unfortunately, our mood and circumstances could impact how we answer, and thus the results. If I'm happy and optimistic, I might respond differently than if I were to have spent a few days being depressed and discouraged about my future. Current life situations could change how you respond to assessment questions. Imagine responding to questions a day after learning about the death of someone who was close to you. I can't even imagine those responses being the same as how you would respond on a routine day. I read about someone whose normal result was an extrovert; however, this person lost their spouse and a few months later when they took the assessment, they scored as an introvert. If you take the assessment every month, I bet you would get different results every month. Sometimes the results would be nominally different, other times they could be significantly different. What does this mean? To me, it means we can't have the results define us or anyone forever. Even if they seem to perfectly explain someone, people change, circumstances change. We need to allow people's personalities and tendencies to be more fluid rather than extremely well defined and constant.

## Notes
- Mood and life circumstances can impact how we answer personality assessment questions.
- Current life situations can lead to different responses, affecting assessment results.
- Grief, loss, or significant life events can alter how we score on assessments, leading to fluctuations in results.
- Personality and tendencies are not static; they can change over time.
- Results from personality assessments should not be seen as permanent labels, as individuals and circumstances evolve.
- Embracing the fluidity of personalities and tendencies can lead to a more nuanced understanding of people.
