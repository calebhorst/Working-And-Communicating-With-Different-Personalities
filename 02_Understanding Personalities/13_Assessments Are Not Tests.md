## Assessments Are Not Tests
```
I've talked about this a bit, and perhaps you've caught on to it, but I don't call these tools personality tests. No one in the industry does. A test has right or wrong answers, and you can get a perfect score on a test. You can also fail a test. An assessment simply assesses where you are at, and there aren't right or wrong answers. Instead of the right answer, we want you to give the most accurate answer for you. Your most accurate answer for a question could be polar opposite than my most accurate answer, but neither of us would be wrong, nor would either of us fail. Assessments are designed to give us a better diagnostic on our personality or our preferences and tendencies. What this means is that you don't have to go into these assessments nervous or worried about any particular result. The results are simply there to help you understand yourself and others better. There is no right or wrong you when it comes to personality assessment results, it's just you.
