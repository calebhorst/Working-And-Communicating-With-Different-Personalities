## Relationships vs. Work
```
Two end results we talk about in this course are our relationships with others and productivity. I'm reminded of a fascinating conversation I had with a boss a few years ago where we talked about a leader's focus on one of these three, people, processes or systems, and product or results. I did an unscientific survey on Twitter where I asked which of the three was most important and was not surprised with the results. Over 60% of the responses were that people were the most important. Product came in second and processes came in third. Contrast that, though, to the embarrassing statistic that somewhere around 75% of us are unhappy at work, even to the point of looking for other opportunities. As you learn about personalities in general and then personalities of people in your team, it's important to have the right objectives in mind. People are critically important. Losing the best people on your team could be devastating, even to the point of disintegrating the team. I recognize that most of us need to have products or services, some deliverable, that justify our role on the team. The product you're working on can be the reason you are treated better, respected, and have better budgets. Great products combined with great sales and marketing create the opportunity to have a better environment for your people. Processes or systems are important for different reasons at different stages of an organization. Sometimes they're critical, but we can put processes and products before people in a way that eventually will ruin what's called our human capital, the teams we've been building. I can't argue which is most important for you because different organizations at different stages should prioritize differently; however, I want to reiterate what Jim Collins said in his landmark book, Good to Great. We need to get the right people on the bus. And I'll add, keep the right people on the bus. This course might help you identify who the right people could be and how to keep them on your bus. When you do that, you should see a measurable improvement in processes and products. Misunderstanding building and maintaining the right team and you might see serious problems with your processes and products.
