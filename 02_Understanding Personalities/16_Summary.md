## Summary
```
In this module, we lay a foundation for talking about personalities and how understanding different personalities and tendencies empower us. This understanding also helps us learn more about ourselves. We talked about working and communicating with others, as well as persuading and influencing. I shared some examples of working with different personalities from my own experience and talked about when understanding personalities can be really helpful. We talked about preferences and tendencies and the concept of leading with. I shared thoughts from Vern, my friend, and then we talked about the sliding scale, as well as generalizing. We talked about gaming the assessment, the impact of moods and circumstances, and critics and criticisms of assessments. We talked about assessments versus tests, allowing for change over time and people, processes, and products. In the next module, we'll dive into the Myers‑Briggs since it is so common. When you're done with that module, you should have a really good idea of what it is and how it can help you understand personalities better. Let's go.
