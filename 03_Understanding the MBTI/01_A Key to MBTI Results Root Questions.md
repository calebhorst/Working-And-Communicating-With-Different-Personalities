## A Key to MBTI Results: Root Questions
```
I've come to realize there's a very important, simple key to understanding Myers‑Briggs results. In each survey, you have a list of questions. At the heart of each question is a root question. You aren't asked route questions, but understanding what they are can help you understand why you're asked each question and how you got the results you got. There's one root question for each of the four parts of the results. The first root question will help you determine if you are an I or an E. The question is, are you outwardly or inwardly focused? You might guess an introvert is inwardly focused. As an example, I'm an introvert. When I'm in a meeting and need to process new, important information, I sometimes need a minute or two to quietly think about it. An extrovert might get nervous with the silence the introvert needs. Quiet time can be very uncomfortable for some people, but just realizing it helps someone inwardly focused assess new information could be very helpful and remove discomfort. Realizing extroverts like to think out loud can help you understand talking through it as an important part of their thinking. They're not rambling or stating the obvious, rather they are taking the information in. Some extroverts need to go through this process, just as introverts need to go through their processes. The root question for the second position is how do you prefer to take in information? If you're sensing, then you prefer facts and details. If you're intuition, you prefer to take ideas and connect them so you can project beyond the facts. Someone who scores high on N, or intuition, also might like figurative or poetic descriptions. Knowing you're working with an N might lead you to use more stories, whereas if you're talking to an S, you'll need to incorporate more facts and details in your communication. The root question for the third position is how do you prefer to make decisions? The thinking person tends to be more concerned about processes and systems than on people and their feelings, whereas the feeling person strives to please others. I once worked with a decisionmaker who was a strong F. There was a situation where someone had been let go from the company because of fraud. The terminated employee appealed to this strong F executive, and to everyone's surprise he actually got his job back. Watching this play out in the workplace was fascinating. Even though the facts were clear and this person should not have been rehired, the F forgave the person and gave him another chance. I can imagine you're cringing as you listen to this example, but just understanding the boss was a feeling person helps us understand why he did it. The root question for the fourth position is how do you prefer to live your outer life? This is a weird question, isn't it? I don't think I've ever talked about my "outer" life in casual conversation. This might help explain the question. The judging person wants to settle their matters. They don't like to leave loose ends hanging. The perceiving person might say, I'll take care of it when I get to it. That might be when they really have to make a decision, but until then, they're good to put it off. While the judging person prefers to have everything planned out, the perceiving person is fine to move forward without detailed plans. When you're trying to make sense of anyone's Myers‑Briggs results, go back to these four root questions. Understanding these root questions can help you better understand MBTI results.

## Notes
- Myers‑Briggs results can be understood through four root questions, each corresponding to one of the four result positions.
- The first root question focuses on whether a person is outwardly or inwardly focused, determining if they are an I (Introvert) or an E (Extrovert).
- Recognizing that extroverts like to think out loud and introverts need quiet time can aid understanding of these personality traits.
- The second root question pertains to how a person prefers to take in information, distinguishing between sensing (facts and details) and intuition (ideas, connections, and projections).
- Knowing if someone scores high on N (intuition) can inform communication approaches, such as using stories for N types and incorporating facts and details for S (sensing) types.
- The third root question concerns decision-making preferences, with thinking individuals focusing on processes and systems and feeling individuals aiming to please others.
- A real-life example is given of a feeling person making a decision based on emotions rather than facts.
- The fourth root question relates to how a person prefers to live their outer life, distinguishing between judging (preferring plans and settled matters) and perceiving (being okay with leaving things unresolved).
- Recognizing these root questions can help interpret Myers‑Briggs results and better understand personality traits.
