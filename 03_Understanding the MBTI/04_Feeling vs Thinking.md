## Feeling vs. Thinking
```
The third position in the Myers‑Briggs results will be either an F or a T, F for feeling and T for thinking. The question we're trying to answer is how do you prefer to make decisions? The feeling person makes decisions based on personal values and how actions affect others. They really think about the other person. On the other hand, the person scoring higher in thinking doesn't necessarily make decisions based on how the action would affect others. They tend to make decisions using logic and reasoning, which can feel very impersonal. The feeling person values harmony and forgiveness, whereas the thinking person values justice and fairness. The feeling person likes to please others and point out the best in people. The thinking person enjoys finding the flaws in an argument. They're not as worried about pleasing others and making sure other people feel good as much as they want to make sure the argument is a good, solid argument. As you can imagine, a feeling person is typically described as someone who is warm and empathetic. A thinking person might not be described as warm or empathetic. They're usually described as reasonable and levelheaded. Can you see that in some situations you'll want a feeling person, perhaps someone you can talk to and get empathy from, while other times you'll really want a thinking person. For example, if you need a lawyer for a very difficult legal situation.
