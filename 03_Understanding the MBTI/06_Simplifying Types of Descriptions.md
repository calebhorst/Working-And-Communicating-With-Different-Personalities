## Simplifying Types of Descriptions
```
As with all assessments, the MBTI strives to simplify how we understand someone or their tendencies by using some type of label or class or categorization system. Using the four letters you see in the results is a simple way to help you understand someone's tendencies better, at least based on how they answered the questions. The funny thing about this attempt to simplify by categorizing is that there are 16 possible results, which doesn't sound very simple. The differences between one and another might be so small and so nuanced, it could be hard to tell the difference between them. Because Myers‑Briggs is so common, there has been a lot of work done to help people understand what the results actually mean. People have come up with labels for each of the results. For example, the ENFJ is the teacher, while the ISTP is the craftsperson. A quick search online will show names for each of the 16 results. In the next few clips, we'll talk about some of the MBTI results, walking through the combinations to help you get a better idea of how to decipher results.

In the next few clips, we'll talk about some of the MBTI results, walking through the combinations to help you get a better idea of how to decipher the results. Keep in mind, these labels are not necessarily ideal job titles, they are just labels people have created to help us understand what various combinations mean. Here's a quick overview. Supposedly the most common personality type is ISTJ, sometimes called the inspector. We'll talk more about the inspector in a few minutes. Again, supposedly, the least common personality type is INFJ, also known as the counselor. We'll go deeper into that in a few minutes. The more common MBTI results are the protector, the composer, the performer, and the provider. Isn't it interesting that the more common results are completely different personality types? Can you think of people you work with or in your personal life who might be a protector, a composer, a performer or a provider? The next most popular results are the crafter, the promoter, and the supervisor. Then you have the healer, the champion, and the teacher. The least common results are the mastermind, the architect, the inventor, and the field marshal. Remember, these are summarized generalizations. Just because you or a colleague get certain MBTI results doesn't mean you are now the field marshal or the provider or whatever. Our personalities, preferences, and tendencies are more complex than one or two word labels. This information, the labels, and how common each of the results are is simply another piece of the vast puzzle of understanding ourselves and others.

## Notes
- The Myers‑Briggs assessment simplifies understanding someone's tendencies through a combination of four letters representing various traits.
- There are 16 possible Myers‑Briggs results, which can be challenging to distinguish due to small nuanced differences.
- Labels have been created to help explain each of the 16 Myers‑Briggs results, such as "the teacher" for ENFJ or "the craftsperson" for ISTP.
- These labels are not job titles but descriptors to aid in understanding the combinations.
- Some common Myers‑Briggs results include the inspector (ISTJ), the protector, the composer, the performer, and the provider.
- Less common results include the crafter, the promoter, the supervisor, the healer, the champion, and the teacher.
- The least common results are the mastermind, the architect, the inventor, and the field marshal.
- These labels provide a simplified way to describe tendencies but do not fully capture the complexity of individual personalities.
