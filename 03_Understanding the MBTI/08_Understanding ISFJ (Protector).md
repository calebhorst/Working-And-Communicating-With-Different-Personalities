## Understanding ISFJ (Protector)
```
The next most common personality type is the ISFJ, sometimes called the protector. As we go through this exercise, I want you to think about how you might do something similar for people you know who aren't one of these four types we're going to dig into. This process should help you understand how you can give them information in the best way. This information can help you persuade others to think or act a certain way. The protector has three of the same characteristics as the last personality type we talked about, namely introvert, sensing, and judging. The only difference between the inspector and the protector is the third position, which is F for feeling instead of T for thinking. The root question for feeling or thinking is how do you prefer to make decisions? The feeling person cares about a person's feelings and how information, decisions, and actions will affect others. They like making decisions based on harmony and relationships. The feeling person likes to please others. The protector values facts and details. They like to have a clear picture of what's going on. They like to think through all the details. But when it comes down to making decisions, they are definitely considerate of people's feelings and how they might be perceived. Does knowing that the protector prefers to make decisions with these characteristics help you know how to better approach or communicate with an ISFJ? You can see how this knowledge can be really powerful.

## Notes
- The Protector, or ISFJ, shares three characteristics with the Inspector (ISTJ): introverted (I), sensing (S), and judging (J).
- The primary difference is in the third position, which is feeling (F) instead of thinking (T).
- **How Do You Prefer to Make Decisions:** Feeling (F); values harmony, relationships, and considers how decisions affect others, likes to please others.

Understanding the characteristics of the Protector can help improve communication and interaction with an ISFJ:
- Consider their preference for harmony and relationships in decision-making.
- Be aware of their focus on how decisions may affect others emotionally.
- Present information with facts and details to align with their sensing preference.
- Be mindful of their introverted nature and allow them space for contemplation.

Recognizing these tendencies can lead to more effective communication and persuasion when dealing with an ISFJ or individuals with similar characteristics.
