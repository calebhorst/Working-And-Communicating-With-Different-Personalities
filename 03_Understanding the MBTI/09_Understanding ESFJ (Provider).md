## Understanding ESFJ (Provider)
```
The third most common personality type is the ESFJ, also known as the provider. You can see with the S that they're sensing, which means they like facts and details. The J says they are judging people, which means they like to have a conclusion to their issues and appreciate deadlines. The provider appreciates plans and doesn't like surprises. The F shows they are feeling people who actually care about other people's feelings. The main difference here is switching from introverted to extraverted. Because the provider is an extravert, they tend to be more talkative and outgoing. They like to be in fastâ€‘paced situations. They tend to think out loud and be the center of attention. How does knowing someone is extraverted help you deal with that person? Being extraverted doesn't mean they're better or worse, right or wrong, we're just using this information to have better relationships and better communication. If you're working with a provider, maybe you let them be the spokesperson for your team. They might want and appreciate this much more than an introvert would. When communicating with a provider, remember, they like data, facts, and details. They care about your feelings and like to come to a conclusion with their projects, all characteristics they share with a protector, they might just be more loud and vocal.

- Acknowledge their preference for fast-paced environments and being the center of attention.
- Utilize their enthusiasm for being spokespersons or team representatives.
