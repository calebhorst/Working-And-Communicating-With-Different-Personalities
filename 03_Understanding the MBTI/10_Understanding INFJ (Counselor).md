## Understanding INFJ (Counselor)
```
In this final example, we'll look at the INFJ, also known as the counselor. Supposedly this is the least common personality type in the United States. The root question we're answering that impacts the second letter is how do you prefer to take in information? The results are either S for sensing or N for intuition. In the case of the counselor, it is N for intuition. People who are N think about how things could be. They see the big picture and the connections that are made between things. They like ideas and concepts. I means they're introverted. The counselor will be thoughtful, they'll see the big picture, maybe things that are on or beyond the horizon. They'll want their matters settled and they'll appreciate rules and deadlines. Sounds like a great person to have on most teams. Now that we've gone through four examples, I'd like you to write down the names of three to five people, whether they are people you work with or have personal relationships with. Guess what their Myers‑Briggs assessment results might be and then list characteristics for each person based on each of the four letters. As you do this, think about your experiences with them. How do they tend to act and communicate? You might be able to identify certain traits, tendencies or preferences that make a lot more sense with this information and through the lens of the Myers‑Briggs assessment. Thinking through this can help you identify times where you communicated well with them or perhaps didn't communicate well at all. This might seem like a tedious exercise, but we're talking about your career, relationships, and communication. When you strive to understand yourself and others, you are closer to better relationships and richer communication. This investment is definitely worth your attention.

Exercise:
1. Write down the names of 3 to 5 people you know.
2. Guess their potential Myers‑Briggs assessment results based on your observations.
3. List characteristics for each person based on each of the four letters (E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P).
4. Reflect on your experiences with them and consider how their tendencies affect their actions and communication.

By engaging in this exercise, you can gain a better understanding of the people in your life, leading to improved relationships and more effective communication.
