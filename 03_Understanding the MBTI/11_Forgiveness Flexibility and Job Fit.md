## Forgiveness, Flexibility, and Job Fit
```
Humans are exceptionally complex. Labeling and stereotyping into nice, precise little buckets or boxes is convenient, but it can do us and others a great disservice. These assessments attempt to help us understand ourselves and others based on preferences and tendencies, but preferences and tendencies are not absolutes. Results can be used to predict, but they won't be 100% accurate all the time. When someone acts contrary to what their assessment results say they would, that's okay. Perhaps they're making conscious decisions to do something intentional in a way that is different, even difficult for them. Being intentional makes actions and reactions more special. Knowledge and assumptions about personalities can be abused. You could look at someone and say you're an introvert, no wonder you act like that, or you're an introvert, you should act differently. Please don't use this information to manipulate or unfairly stereotype others. We need to make sure we forgive people for shortcomings in how they act or communicate. We're all human, right? Let people be human. Let others act within their strengths while still having weaknesses. Forgiving people puts us in a different mindset and might even help us learn how to forgive ourselves for our shortcomings. The Myers‑Briggs Type Indicator gives us information, but we need to allow for flexibility. Don't expect everyone to always act the way they should based on assessment results. Maybe those results were off because of when they took the test or circumstances that influence their answers. Many times, Myers‑Briggs results are used to determine job fit or how well someone might fit into a team. These assessments can have a real significant impact on your future. Take them seriously if they're used in your organization or if they are important to your boss. A key takeaway from this course is to allow for forgiveness and flexibility when working and communicating with others.
