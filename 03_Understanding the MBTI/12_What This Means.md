## What This Means
```
The Myers‑Briggs Type Indicator is merely a tool. It's time tested, having been used for decades around the world. It has become a popular lens through which we try to understand what motivates others, who they are, and what makes them tick. It's also a tool that has plenty of controversy. It's not perfect. Maybe it's a little too complex. Maybe it's a little too simple. There are other tools that claim to be more effective than the Myers‑Briggs. I want you to look at it for what it is, simply a tool. It gives us data or information by which we can make decisions and judgments. The data or information can be flawed, swayed by feelings or circumstances. Even so, we can use this information along with other information we have to get a better understanding of people. Keep in mind, the goal is to understand ourselves and others, and we should use any tool that can help with that. Feel free to learn more about the pros and cons of MBTI and then consider those things as you use the results. If nothing else, please think about the I and the E, the S and the N, the F and the T and the P and the J. Think about what each of those letters mean and how they impact your understanding of others. The more you dig into this, the more you'll see important characteristics and personality traits in others and in yourself. Like I said earlier, knowledge of human nature isn't just a power, it's a superpower
