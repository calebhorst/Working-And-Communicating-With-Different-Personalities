## Summary
```
In this module, we explored the Myers‑Briggs Type Indicator to help us understand what the MBTI assesses and what the results mean. We talked about the root questions and then differentiated between introversion and extraversion, sensing and intuition, feeling and thinking, and perceiving and judging. We went into 4 of 16 personality types to better understand what those types meant and better understand what each letter means. We talked about the idea of flexibility with labels and categories, and now here we are wrapping up this module. In the next module, we're going to talk about a different assessment tool, the DiSC assessment. This is another common tool we see organizations use to help us understand ourselves and one another. Let's get started.
