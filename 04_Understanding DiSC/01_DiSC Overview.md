## DiSC Overview
```
Because no one owns DiSC, there are multiple versions that are based on the DiSC methodology. This means there are a bunch of different ways DiSC can be administered and interpreted. With that in mind, I'll try to stay as general as I can, respecting nuances from different organizations. Each of the four letters in DiSC stand for something. D stands for dominance. I stands for influence. S stands for steadiness. C stands for conscientious. Your DiSC results might be something like D or D/S. It could even be D/S/C. Mirroring what I've said before and consistent with similar tools, you lead with one and are a mix of the others. If your primary style is D for dominance, you want to win. If you think a dominant person is bossy, you might be right, but dig deeper to understand what the dominant person is about, what drives them. They need to win. They work to create an environment and team so they can win. Sometimes, though, the dominant person seems like they don't care about others because they are so focused on winning. The I style is influence. Think of the person who strives to bring people together to influence and persuade others. This might be the person who says come on team, let's do this. They might be known for their high energy, excitement, and enthusiasm. On the other hand, they might be known for being unorganized and maybe a little too light on facts and details. The S, or steadiness style, indicates you likely work to get the job done and reduce contention in your team. You want harmony, people working together and enjoying the team. You like rules, roles, and order. You might be the one to say, come on, can't we all just get along? The conscientious person likes to learn and share what they've learned. They appreciate quality and accuracy. They might be seen as a perfectionist, which can be annoying in some situations, but really valuable in others. Actually, any of these traits can feel annoying in some situations, but valuable in others, and that's one of the recurring themes in this course. There is no right or wrong way to be. Please accept and internalize this for yourself and for others. The goal here is not to become the same, rather to gain understanding of ourselves and others and learn how these traits and characteristics can help improve working relationships and communication with others.
