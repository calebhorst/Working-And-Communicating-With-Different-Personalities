## Debrief Behaviors
```
As with any similar assessment or test result, you should figure out how to debrief your results. DiSC administrators are trained to debrief results with you so you can really understand at a more granular level what the results mean. Even though you might be a D/S, or whatever, your DiSC results can be pages and pages long. Talking to a trained DiSC administrator can really help you understand your results. I'm a big fan of debriefing. I talk about it in some of my other courses as a step to help ensure you maximize learning and understanding. In this specific example, I invite you to have a qualified DiSC administrator debrief your results with you. In other situations, or if you can't find a DiSC administrator, I invite you to debrief with someone else or even just by yourself. To debrief by yourself, set aside time without distractions to really ponder the information you have. Think about your opportunities or what the information means. What impact could this have on your career, your relationships, your communication, and your future? What could you learn about yourself that might increase job satisfaction or help you manage expectations you have about yourself? I recommend journaling your thoughts and ideas, epiphanies, and action items. This could be in a physical journal, a book you actually write in, or it could be in a series of emails you write to yourself or a document on the cloud, which is where I tend to record thoughts like these. There's power in journaling, and this is something worth your time. The questions I asked just a few seconds ago could be answered and revisited over time. The idea is to really get to know yourself. DiSC results are complex enough that you should spend time pondering and debriefing, but really, any personality assessment results you get should be debriefed. Whether you talk to a close friend who will be honest with you to ask about the validity of your results or you spend a lot of time journaling your thoughts, I encourage you to have a thorough debrief.
