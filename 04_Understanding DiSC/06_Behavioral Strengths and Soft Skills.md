## Behavioral Strengths and Soft Skills
```
If you have seen any of my other courses or the titles of my courses, you'll know I'm passionate about soft skills. I've seen the impact soft skills have on my own career when hiring others, when intense situations, in helping preserve important relationships, when making sales, and more. In my course, Leading with Emotional Intelligence, I talk about soft skills a lot. Every single one of the five pillars of emotional intelligence has everything to do with soft skills. They're so important that the fifth pillar, social skills, is even sometimes called soft skills. Soft skills help us communicate better, understand others, and have richer and more appropriate relationships. Soft skills are an excellent complement to hard skills. Imagine being great at whatever technical proficiencies you need to have and being able to communicate in an effective way with others, which is what soft skills helps with. I believe soft skills, like any skill, can be learned and improved on. To get better at any soft skill, you should have an awareness of the skill, perhaps learn tactics and techniques, and regularly practice those skills. Sometimes you'll see quick improvement, other times you'll feel like you're working on them for years and not seeing much progress. The DiSC assessment tells you what your behavioral strengths are. If you look at those strengths, you should draw correlations to soft skills. Some of those soft skills will be great in some situations. For example, listening might be one of your prominent skills if you're an S, while taking commands might be a prominent skill if you are a D. Thinking about your DiSC results through this lens, I invite you to think about two ideas. The first is to think about what soft skills you inherently have or practice based on your assessment results. If you're an S, you are probably a naturally good listener. What if you spent time working on listening skills with best practice techniques and tactics? What if you really become disciplined in your natural strength and get further training? I encourage you to get better at what comes natural to you. You might be good or great at it. What if you worked on becoming excellent at it? The second idea is to think about what you are not naturally good at, but should be. What soft skills could help you be more effective in your role? If you are a D and are naturally good at problem solving, what soft skills could make you a more effective communicator? I've worked with dominant people who were excellent at problem solving, but not very good at reading the room or understanding others. Dominants want to get a problem solved very quickly, and sometimes they do that in a way that feels harsh to others. What if you, as a D, worked on empathy and persuasion? You could marry your natural strength of problem solving with a skill that helps you communicate more effectively. Can you imagine how powerful those two skills could be together? Here's my twofold invitation. Work on the skills that come naturally to you with more discipline and training and figure out what soft skills complement those skills associated with your disk results and make a plan to improve those. One of my hopes for you is continual growth, especially in soft skills. These two tactics could lead to some serious personal growth.

## Notes
- Soft skills are crucial for effective communication, understanding others, and building better relationships.
- Soft skills complement technical proficiency (hard skills) and can be learned and improved.
- DiSC assessment results can help identify behavioral strengths, which correlate with certain soft skills.
- Consider improving the soft skills that align with your DiSC results and those that can enhance your effectiveness in your role.
- Focus on both honing the skills that come naturally to you and developing skills that complement your strengths, leading to personal growth.
