## Assessment Results and Your Brand
```
As we wrap up these two modules where we explored the Myers‑Briggs and the DiSC assessments, I want to talk about one of my favorite topics, personal branding. I have a course on personal branding which includes a bunch of tactics you can use to create and reinforce the right brand for you. Regarding these assessments, I want to share an opportunity and a cautionary warning. The opportunity is to take things you've learned and use words, phrases, and ideas to craft your branding statements. There might be things you've learned from your experience with the MBTI and the DiSC assessment that you never really thought about. I know I've had characteristics I didn't put much thought into until I saw them in my results. Once you have this information, you can start to talk about it more. This includes in interviews, networking situations, on resumes, and your LinkedIn profile, etc. Wherever you put branding statements, you can put some of this information. I'm not saying that you have to, but you can. I want you to be intentional and strategic about what you include in your branding statements, which I talk about in my Personal Branding course. Here are some examples. I work best when I have lots of projects to work on. I excel at leading others and I work well in stressful environments. I am not necessarily a good team leader, but I thrive when I have consistent work to do and the right resources. You can see I'm using insights from assessment results to talk up strengths or even answer interview questions like what is one of your greatest weaknesses. My cautionary warning is just as important, beware of assumptions and stereotypes that come with labels and generalizations, even from assessment results. When people find out you're an INFJ or a C/S, they might make all kinds of wrong assumptions about you. One of the great things about these assessment results is that we can easily categorize and group people. One of the worst things about these assessment results is that we can easily, too easily, categorize and group people. When people learn you are an introvert, they might stereotype you with introvert attributes. They might be correct or they could be way off. After speaking on stage, I've had people come up and say, huh, you were a programmer? I didn't know programmers could be public speakers. This was an assumed attribute based on a stereotype that people put on me that was clearly wrong. The same thing can happen to you. One of my main points in my Personal Branding course is that people already have assumptions about you. Many times they are wrong and many times they are not what you want them to be. I want you to be intentional about your brand. If you aren't, you'll still have a brand, it will just be the wrong brand. So, learn about your personality results and make sure you create some branding statements to help break out of stereotypes. For example, I know I'm an introvert, but I actually thrive in certain social situations. You can put me in front of customers, prospects, and executives and I can make a very compelling and persuasive presentation. That's not to say that introverts can't do that, but a lot of people think introverts will freeze in front of people. This is a simple example of overcoming stereotypes to help define and refine your personal brand. Please watch my Personal branding course and intentionally work on your brand.
