## Understanding Others
```
When you understand your preferences and tendencies regarding how you want to receive information, you understand why you might share information with others in a way that makes sense to you, but might not consider how they want to receive information. The fourth pillar of emotional intelligence is sometimes called empathy, sometimes called awareness of others. I think awareness of others empowers us to have more and more appropriate empathy. Awareness of others means we hear others, we see them, and we seek to understand them. I've had plenty of personal and professional relationships where I've not understood others, their intentions, and how they prefer to give or receive information, and that has had a profound impact on my relationships. I'm not saying that understanding others means you will have better relationships with everyone you meet. There are going to be people you don't agree with, don't like, and don't want to be around. That's fine. But understanding others, their preferences, and tendencies could help you better understand why you don't like them or why you aren't communicating effectively with them. This awareness can help you make improvements or make a mature decision on how to proceed with the relationship. At work, where we sometimes don't have the luxury of moving away from certain people or relationships, understanding others can help you get work done better and in a more enjoyable way, not because you are changing other people, rather because you learn why they do and think and communicate the way they do. Understanding others can help remove bad emotions and petty likes and dislikes from your personal and professional relationships. Earlier in this course, I talked about a superpower. Learning how to persuade and influence others can be your superpower. An important component of this superpower is understanding who you want to persuade and influence.
