## Allowing for Flexibility and Scalability
```
Two of my favorite words with software and products are flexibility and scalability, or really personal growth. I loved the idea of creating flexible code, meaning it could be used in various scenarios, even scenarios we hadn't thought about. I also loved creating code that would scale, products that could grow as needed because they were designed for growth. This made the code or the final output adaptable to changes. I found one of the most constant changes in this world is people. People are constantly growing, learning, facing experiences and challenges, coming into good fortune or bad fortune, and coming to terms with themselves all the time. I've already talked about allowing for flexibility with assessment results, recognizing a margin of error or results that were impacted by mood or other circumstances. I want to emphasize that people change. There are experiences we have in life that create great change, such as job loss, death of a loved one or another tragedy like a car accident. These experiences can change the way we think about society and our place in society. Other changes might come from promotions or lack of promotions. When I was in high school I had a pretty solid view of myself; I had high selfâ€‘confidence and a very optimistic outlook on my future. Since then, I've had a number of experiences that were not aligned with my optimistic outlook. I've experienced failures and setbacks that have impacted my perspective. I continued to be optimistic, but there were times when I was ready to give up and change careers or make other significant changes in my life. Some of the changes we experience are subtle and happen over long periods of time. They might come from wins or losses we have. They can impact how we think, how we open or close ourselves to relationships, and how we communicate with others. Someone you worked with 10 years ago might be a completely different person than who they are today. You might be a completely different person than who you were 10 years ago. I invite you to allow for change and allow how you perceive yourself and others to change.
