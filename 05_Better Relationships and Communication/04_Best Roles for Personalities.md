## Best Roles for Personalities
```
One of the reasons companies, recruiters, and career counselors like personality assessments is because it gives them data they can use to align people and their personalities with roles. I haven't always agreed with the results I've gotten from career counselors, especially when I was in high school. They seemed to be reaching for weird job titles. I'm sure it was backed up by lots of data, but I already thought I knew what I wanted to do for a living, and none of their results matched that. Still, though, if you're not happy with your role, perhaps it makes sense to look at what the results tell you. Take some assessments, maybe multiple times, to figure out what you might average out to and then do research on best careers for those results. Knowing what I know now, my questions would have been what do these results have in common and what is it about these jobs or roles that I'm supposed to be a fit for? For example, a quick online search shows the best jobs for an ISTJ includes accountant and programmer. Now that you understand what an I and S and T and J mean, that makes sense, doesn't it? I'm not saying you will only find success in a job that is aligned with your assessment results. I'm sure there are people who are not ISTJs that would do well at the jobs listed for ISTJs, but perhaps those are the jobs where you'll find the most job satisfaction and fulfillment. Those jobs might be well aligned with your preferences and tendencies. Use assessment results as data points as you learn more about yourself. Just remember, these are but a few of many data points. When I was in my university's computer program, I was surprised anyone would think being in liberal arts, like humanities or theater, could be a good career choice. I remember arrogantly thinking that everyone should study computers. Doesn't that sound horrible? I'm sad to admit, that is how I thought back then. I eventually realized a successful organization can benefit from all kinds of people. You need the persistent salesperson, You need the introverted and shy developer. You need the accountant who could spend hours on spreadsheets. You need the creative minds for writing better copy and creating beautiful designs and graphics. My thinking finally aligned with the idea that there is no right or wrong personality. No one is better or worse. All personalities and skills can add value somewhere, and they are all necessary.

## Notes
- Personality assessments can be helpful for aligning individuals with suitable roles and career paths.
- While initial results may not always align with one's career aspirations, it's valuable to consider what common attributes or characteristics those suggested roles share.
- Personality assessments can provide insights into preferences and tendencies that may lead to greater job satisfaction and fulfillment.
- It's important to remember that assessment results are just one set of data points among many, and they shouldn't be the sole determinant of one's career path.
- Embracing diversity in personality types and skills is essential in any organization, as each individual brings unique strengths and perspectives to the table.
