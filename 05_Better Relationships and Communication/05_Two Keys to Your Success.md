## Two Keys to Your Success
```
There is a lot of information in this course. My intention isn't to make you a Myersâ€‘Briggs or DISC expert, rather I want to give you enough information so you could start to make sense of the personalities around you. There are two things I think that are key to your success with this knowledge. First, understand what your preferences are. How do you prefer to receive information, how do you prefer to make decisions, and other questions we've talked about in this course. Instead of wishing you were someone else or comparing yourself to others, just own what your preferences are. You shouldn't be ashamed of or embarrassed about your preferences or personality type or style. When you understand your preferences, you can recognize your strengths and know what situations you would excel in. You can also recognize your weaknesses and help people understand what a great or poor match is for you. With this honest assessment and understanding, you can determine the skills you should focus on. If you have weaknesses in certain areas you know you should work on, focus on those. The second key is to appropriately communicate this information with others. It usually doesn't do you any good to hide your strengths, preferences, and tendencies from others. As you communicate your preferences, you increase the chances to have better relationships and more effective communication. When a team communicates personality types, preferences, and tendencies, we can become aware of who will excel in which situations and perhaps who shouldn't do certain things like present in front of executives. You can better ensure each person contributes with their greatest abilities and strengths and even identify who should get specialized training. I'm not saying people shouldn't grow into certain tasks or roles, but knowing your preferences and tendencies could help you know when you might need to team up with someone who has strengths that complement your personality. Appropriately communicating this information can help your team be more effective.
