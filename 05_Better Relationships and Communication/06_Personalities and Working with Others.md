## Personalities and Working with Others
```
As you learn to understand yourself and others with an allowance for forgiveness and flexibility, you are putting yourself in a better position of enhanced work relationships. Instead of going to work and dreading the people you work with, maybe because you don't understand them or they don't understand you, you can work around differences. You can be a more effective teammate and appreciate others for what they bring to the team. Instead of feeling annoyed or even jealous of how others work, you can appreciate differences and diversity in your teams. You see that effective teams need different strengths, and you can value or even express appreciation for what everyone brings. As everyone on your team appreciates one another's personalities, preferences, and tendencies, your team gets to a point where personality quirks don't matter. You can focus more on the task at hand and on delivering better products and services for your customers. Can you imagine how great that team would be? You should see an increase in job satisfaction, which is something HR is usually acutely concerned about, as well as retention and productivity. This work environment becomes fun, it is a team you want to be a part of, you find yourself giving your best because you know your work is seen and valued and you know your teammates are competent and high contributors. This is my vision, creating better work environments because we have less friction with people and different personalities. This doesn't happen when we ignore different behavior, rather because we increase our understanding of personalities and human nature.
